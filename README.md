# VendingMachine
 
Used Spring 2.7.3 with Java 8 - REST design.
Packaging is set as war file.
You can either import the war file or import it from here in Spring-Tools-Suite(or eclipse or similar with spring) and run it from there or upload the war file on a tomcat server.
For DB I used H2 as the data persistance is not required.
